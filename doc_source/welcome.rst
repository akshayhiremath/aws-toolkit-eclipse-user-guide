What is the |tke|?
##################

The |tke|_ is an open source plug-in for the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) that
makes it easier for developers to develop, debug, and deploy Java applications that use |AWSlong|.
It enhances the Eclipse IDE with additional features:

* The |sdk-java| is included and managed by Maven when you create a new AWS project using the |tke|

* |explorer|, an interface to |AWSlong| that allows you to manage your AWS resources from within the
  Eclipse environment.

* |LAMlong| Java project and Serverless Application Model (SAM) project blueprint creation,
  deployment and debugging

* |ACClong| repository cloning

* Integration with |ACSlong|

* |EBlong| deployment and debugging

* An |CFNlong| template editor

* Support for multiple AWS accounts

.. important:: There is no charge for using the |tke|, however you may incur AWS charges for
   creating or using AWS :gloss:`chargeable resources <chargeable-resources>`, such as running |EC2|
   instances or using |S3| storage. You can use the `AWS Simple Monthly Calculator
   <http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`_ to estimate charges for the use of various AWS
   resources.
